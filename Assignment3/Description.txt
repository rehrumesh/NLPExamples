1. Consider the following fragment of English grammar.
    S --> NP VP                                      D --> a | the
    NP --> D N                                        N --> boy | girl | dog | cat | garden
    VP --> V | V NP | V NP PP               V --> saw | chased | slept | barked
    PP --> P NP                                     P --> with | into | from | at
(a).  Define the above grammar in NLTK and give the parse tree generated by its Recursive Descent Parser for the noun phrase “the boy chased a dog”.
(b).  Modify the grammar above to handle the following sentences. [Hint: only rules need to be added].
(i).  the fierce dog saw a cat
(ii).  the girl with long hair slept
(iii).  the three tall black dogs barked
(c).  How could the grammar defined using the additional rules of (b) above be modified while also making sure that the following sentences are rejected. [Hint: needs to define features to handle these].
(i).  a cat chased
(ii).  the boy slept the cat

2. Define a simple grammar for your mother tongue that is able to handle the following grammar.
(a).  Able to parse simple SOV structured sentences
(b).  The S(ubject) and O(bject) should be able to be simple nouns, simple
determiners with nouns, simple determiners with a single adjective followed by a noun, pronouns or simple (single token) proper nouns. [Hint: need only rules].
(c).  The number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine) of the subject should match with that of the verb. [Hint: needs features to be defined].
Your submission should be uploaded as a single zip file containing a doc or pdf file of your answers and the relevant python code in separate files, and should be named as your index number.
NB: You are advised to look at the example English and Sinhala grammars given in the VLE.
